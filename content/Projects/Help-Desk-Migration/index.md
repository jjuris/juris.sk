## Project Overview
The primary task was to migrate processes and data from HP OpenView Service Desk to the new HP Service Manager software for Police ČR.
My role involved leading the design and the migration, ensuring minimal disruption to police operations. I completed the project on time,
delivering a fully functional system despite tight delivery schedule.

## Key Challenges
The biggest hurdle was not data migration itself, but recreating a similar look & feel in the new UI to ease user transition. Customer had to accept small differences,
which we addressed through targeted training sessions. This required close collaboration with end-users to map old workflows intuitively.

## Solution and Process
We started with data export/import, validating every record for accuracy in a secure environment. For UI alignment, I designed custom dashboards and workflows in Service Manager,
iterating based on feedback from police IT staff. Prototypes were tested in phases, with hands-on demos to build confidence.

## Results and Learnings
The project was successfully delivered, with users reporting high satisfaction and quick adoption. It boosted efficiency in ticket handling by streamlining processes.
Personally, this was a pleasant experience—it showed me how empathy in change management turns potential resistance into smooth success.
