I took every task seriously and quickly became the top in resolving tickets. But the work lacked creativity, so it was time for a change. ID Admin / Service Desk 2010 Service Management This role marked my move to Prague, opening the multicultural world of the city to me. The work was monotonous, broken only by calls from desperate users worldwide struggling with their computers. The promised technical position never materialized, and I knew I could not stay in this role — it was time to move on. Software Specialist / Local System Administrator 2011 Multi-role Infrastructure After two big global companies, I wanted to try a small firm as local admin. Finally, I had my own rack with servers, switches, routers, IP phones, cameras, computers, laptops, and printers. Later, I also supported our internal customers with kiosk software and did outsourced support for another company. The firm had no processes, so I could use my creativity to build them. I used my past experience to create my own framework for communication, fixing problems, and training. I felt great in this multi-role job, traveling across the entire Czech Republic — to small towns for kiosks and big factories as UPS Software Specialist, where I saw real data centers from the inside. Big milestones were moving firm to a new site and building a network of kiosk terminals. This experiences made me crave work on projects that start in people's minds and end up in reality. Technology Consultant 2014 ITSM Implementation I returned to my roots, to my first employer, but no longer as a user of the ticketing system — now as its creator. I worked on implementing ITSM software for an insurance company and a telecom firm, culminating in the full migration of an old solution to a new one for the police — a project I led end-to-end on my own. The technology, however, was outdated, and I once again experienced the stifled processes of a global corporation. System Administrator 2016 Internet Services Infrastructure I decided to put the suit away and return to the servers. I took a position as admin at a local internet giant, managing popular services from servers and operating systems to databases, storage, and even frontend. In this role, I truly found myself. But we couldn't find a stable fourth team member, and management decided to split our team and services among others. DevOps 2018 Kubernetes \u0026amp; Automation Fortunately, I received an invitation from the recommendation systems team to help them migrate components to Kubernetes. From an admin, I became a developer. With the team, we started a new era where manual deployments turned into developer routine thanks to automation and orchestration. Site Reliability Engineer 2020 Team Autonomy \u0026amp; Specialization The company's IT began transforming from a \"everyone does everything\" style to highly specialized teams — one for OpenStack, another for Kubernetes, databases, and storage. When the time came, we proposed that our recommendation systems team would manage our own product ourselves, led by developers. We gained team recognition for this initiative, and each of us in the team takes on the SRE role from time to time. Infrastructure \u0026amp; Platform Engineer Today Full-Stack Platform Engineering Today, I handle everything I've experienced in my career so far: helping a research colleague troubleshoot a database connection issue, developing CI pipelines, assisting with migrating our system to a newer infrastructure service version, calculating budgets for services next year, negotiating with product managers and directors on the technological vision of our system, and occasionally solving operational problems.

Those years shaped how I view the world: as a series of elegant patterns waiting to be understood. Every equation felt like a dialogue with logic itself, and through that dialogue, I learned discipline, patience, and curiosity. Pavol Jozef Šafárik University 2006 – 2008 Košice, Slovakia During my time at the [university](https://www.upjs.sk), I found a way to transform the abstract beauty of mathematics into something practical — communication with machines. Informatics turned numbers into code, and logic into functionality. It was here that problem-solving evolved from a personal challenge to a creative process of building tools that could think alongside me. Unicorn College 2014 – 2016 Prague, Czech Republic At [Unicorn College](https://unicornuniversity.net), I learned that technology's real power lies not only in precision, but in coordination. I discovered how to manage ideas, people, and projects — to turn vision into structured execution. It completed the circle: mathematics gave me logic, informatics gave me language, and project management taught me connection. Each institution, in its way, helped define the professional and person I've become.

What started as a solution for just 5 researchers has scaled to support 30 researchers, 15 developers plus a growing analytics team. This project became particularly valuable with the shift to Apple M1 laptops, where x86_64 emulation caused brutal performance drops for some local components.\nTechnical Solution # The system uses Terraform to provision VMs in OpenStack, handling infrastructure creation declaratively and scalably. Ansible then takes over for fine-grained OS configuration, ensuring consistency across machines. Together, they manage more than 50 VMs under my control — personal ones, shared ones, and a few equipped with cutting-edge GPUs. With minor adaptations, the same approach now configures my Kubernetes clusters too.\nKey Benefits # Remote terminal access to these VMs proved essential for colleagues traveling, letting them connect without running heavy local emulations and saving precious mobile data. The automation eliminated manual setup errors and adapted smoothly as our team grew sixfold. Personally, building this gave me hands-on mastery of IaC tools while directly boosting team productivity.\n","date":"1 January 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/project/personal-development-space/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Personal development space","type":"project"},{"content":" Background # At the beginning of our recommendation system’s development, we used simple algorithms focused on popularity, trending topics, and readership metrics. These early methods were easy to implement and produced acceptable results. However, as the user base and content volume grew, it became clear that automated content recommendations were far more effective in engaging users than editorial selection. This realization led us toward building a data-driven recommendation system powered by modern machine learning techniques.\nChallenge # The initial architecture relied on manually configured models, trained and deployed by developers. Every adjustment to the training setup required rebuilding Docker images and creating a new deployment release. This process slowed experimentation and limited iteration speed.\nAs we added more complex models using Vowpal Wabbit and later TensorFlow, new challenges emerged:\nThe need for systematic A/B testing to evaluate model performance. High resource costs from idle trainers waiting for manual configuration. Inefficient memory usage caused by the serving layer loading all trained models into a single production server. These architectural limitations restricted both scalability and experimentation freedom.\nSolution # To overcome these challenges, we introduced several technological improvements that gradually evolved into a comprehensive ML Ops framework.\nConsul-Based Configuration We redefined the training process by introducing multiple trainers with dynamic configurations stored in Consul. This allowed non-technical team members to configure experiments directly without developer involvement. Result: Faster testing cycles and easier experiment management.\nAdminWeb Platform We developed AdminWeb, a user-facing interface for product and research teams. It centralized experiment definitions, making configuration management accessible and transparent. Result: Unified control and visibility of experiments.\nModel Manager and Terraform Integration The Model Manager retrieved configuration data from AdminWeb and used Terraform to provision all necessary Kubernetes resources — including trainers, serving deployments, services, and configuration maps. Result: Fully automated lifecycle management. When an experiment was removed, Terraform automatically cleaned up all related resources, ensuring a consistent and efficient infrastructure.\nOutcome # This transformation ultimately shaped a functional and scalable ML Ops pipeline for our recommendation system. It allowed:\nRapid experimentation and controlled A/B testing. Reduced operational overhead and better resource utilization. Seamless integration between machine learning workflows and production infrastructure. The result was a more stable, efficient, and transparent system for delivering personalized recommendations — a process that evolved from simple heuristics into a robust ML-driven operation.\n","date":"1 January 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/project/from-simple-recommendations-to-mlops/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"From Simple Recommendations to MLOps","type":"project"},{"content":" Project overview # Self-service deployment into production marked a key evolution in our team’s operations. As a former admin, I witnessed firsthand how manual processes created bottlenecks, but Kubernetes and GitOps tools like ArgoCD empowered developers to take ownership.\nFrom Admin Dependency to Autonomy # Back when I managed deployments, every production release required admins to manually move Debian packages to the right branch, select servers with enough capacity, and deploy components. Kubernetes eliminated this routine work, yet admins still controlled production access. With our internal cloud maturing and admin teams specializing, developers gained independent deployment rights—shifting mindsets from gatekeeping to collaboration.\nCI/CD Pipeline Evolution # Initially, we adapted our CI/CD with an internal tool that generated Kubernetes manifests for web-based deployment. Today, ArgoCD handles this seamlessly via GitOps, syncing changes declaratively and reducing errors. This upgrade cut deployment times dramatically, much like cases where teams saw 90% faster releases.\nDeveloper Ownership and On-Call Impact # Our team now holds production on-call because no one understands our product better than its builders. Reliable production quality means each weekly rotator gets financial compensation plus a personal day off—a fair win that boosts motivation. This autonomy fosters faster feedback and accountability, aligning with industry gains in productivity and reduced bottlenecks.\n","date":"1 January 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/project/self-service-deployment-into-the-production/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Self-service deployment into the production","type":"project"},{"content":" Project Overview # Migrating our components to Kubernetes marked a pivotal shift in our deployment strategy, streamlining operations and boosting efficiency.\nPackaging Shift # We transitioned library packaging from Debian packages to Python packages, simplifying dependencies and improving portability across environments.

This change ensured optimal resource allocation dynamically.\nConfiguration Evolution # Fixed configuration files were replaced with environment variables, offering greater flexibility for different environments like dev, staging, and production. Updates became simpler without rebuilding entire packages.\nKey Benefits # Deployment speed surged, with faster rollouts and rollbacks thanks to Kubernetes’ orchestration . Resource hunting time dropped to zero, as the cluster handles provisioning automatically, allowing our admin team to focus on other tasks rather than legacy ops.
